```

2. Run the gfwanalysis.sh shell script in development mode.

### Code structure

The API has been packed in a Python module (gfwanalysis). It creates and exposes a WSGI application. The core functionality
has been divided in three different layers or submodules (Routes, Services and Models).

There are also some generic submodules that manage the request validations, HTTP errors and the background tasks manager.
